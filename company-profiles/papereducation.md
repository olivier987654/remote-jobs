Live Help

Paper provides a comprehensive Educational Support System (ESS). The ESS consists of a number of student, teacher and administrator tools. They are best known for the online tutoring that provides 24/7 live help and essay review. For students, Paper provides schools with the ability to offer students with chat-based access to tutors. Tutors working for Paper are regarded as an extension of each school’s individual teaching staff. Teachers are granted access to see their student's tutoring interactions. Teachers also receive insights to help inform their teaching and have a pulse on their class' assessments.

Writing Feedback

In response to requests for writing specific feedback, Paper launched a service called Essay Review. Essay review allows any written work to be annotated and reviewed by a writing specific tutor who helps the student advance their written skills.

Initially intended for language arts classes, Essay Review began being used by students in all classes, as well as for resumes and other personal writing pieces. In 2020, Paper introduced the “plagiar-eyes” badge. The badge appears on reviewed essays. It lets students and teachers know that there is work required to remove any instances of plagiarism. [
